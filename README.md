# House-Of-Developers-Hackathon-Blockchain
This repository have code of the deployment script for the solidity code implementing problem statement - Securing Physical assets using blockchain. 
Physical assets for the long time aren't secured and almost every time we exchange a physical asset there's this 3rd party which creates discrepancy. Blockchain actually focusses on removing this 3rd party from the whole system of buying and selling physical assets. That's what is implemented here.
